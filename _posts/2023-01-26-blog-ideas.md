        - What are you planning on doing for your "how-to" post? 
        I am thinking I would like to do something with R since I just finished 250. Either how to do simulation studies or some kind of graphic.
        - What book are going planning on reading for data science ethics?  
        I am reading "Hello World" by Hannah Fry
        - Where are you hoping to get data for your main class project?  
        The only place I really know to get data is from Kaggle.
