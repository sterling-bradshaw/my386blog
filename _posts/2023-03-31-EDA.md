## Introduction
As my [previous blog post](https://sterling-bradshaw.github.io/my386blog/2023/03/15/Data-Gather.html) mentioned, I would be looking at data from the total game scores to look at trends over time. Now that the data has been collected and put into a dataframe (found in my [Github Repo](https://github.com/sterling-bradshaw/386Project) called NBAGames.csv). There are definitely some interesting trends and comparisons to be made here in terms of exploring this data. A few things we will be looking at is comparing average total scores since 1980, comparing the Finals champions to the runner ups, and breaking down the Western Conference vs. Eastern Conference scoring trends (as well as within each division).

## Total Scoring Over the Decades
By no means, was I expecting the average scoring per game in the NBA to have such a wide discrepency over the years. I figured the average would deviate maybe 10-15 points up or down throughout the last few decades, but we see much more deviation in the following graph.
